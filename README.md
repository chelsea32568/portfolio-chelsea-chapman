My Project Portfolio

## Description 
This webpage contains some of the most recent projects that I have been working on. The aim was to create a webpage that creates an accessible webpage which clearly shows my projects and allows users to view my projects. Throughout this project, I have developed my understanding of css grids and css flex box. Moving forward, I will add media queries to my page to make it more user friendly on different devices and I will include links and titles to my projects. This task was completed using VS Code.
